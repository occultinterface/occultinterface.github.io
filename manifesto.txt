An increase in technological skill is an increase in power.

Any increase in power should be accompanied by a greater understanding of the cultural structures that guide that power, and an effort to become someone that will use that power wisely.

Therefore, I will learn about Technology, Culture and Spirituality together. I will do so through artistic projects that integrate all three.

This page exists to share those projects. It's here to tell the story of what I am creating, and who I am becoming.


I am a young Human in the 21st century, . We are peering furthest into the cosmos than anyone before us, editing genes and creating artificial intelligence, yet we have trampled the biodiversity of the Earth under our progress.

Our species grows exponentially in technological power, tackling increasingly complex challenges and conquering peaks of achievement once deemed unreachable. It is an exciting age to be alive. Yet we are plagued with contradictions.

We are ultra-connected yet isolated, depressed and anxious. We still struggle with the same existential issues that plagued the prophets and philosophers of antiquity. We are not kind, patient, peaceful or happy, and each new tool we create amplifies individual and social flaws we never solved.

The biodiversity of the Earth is trampled under our progress and we accelerate towards an ecological catastrophe that could well end our civilisation.
