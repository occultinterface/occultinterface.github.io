    <p class="triadLeft">I am an animal. Yet, unlike animals, every day I seek to transcend my basic nature. This <mark>quest to change the inner world I will call <i>Spirituality</i>.</mark></p>

    <p class="triadCentre">I live immersed in an invisible world of collective symbols and fictions that guide my every thought and move. This <mark>virtual world of shared symbols I will call <i>Culture</i>.</mark></p>

    <p class="triadRight">I augment my influence over the physical world through systems of knowledge and tools. This <mark>extension of power over the material world I will call <i>Technology</i>.</mark></p>

    <p class="centred">

      I will, therefore, explore all three together. Every project you see here will be an effort to increase technological skills, cultural awareness, and spiritual growth at once. Through each project, I alter myself and write my future:
      this much
      is in my hands right now. </p>
