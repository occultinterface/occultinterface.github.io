      <h3>I am a creative Human Being.</h3>

      <p>This means that I am an animal, closely related to Chimpanzees. Yet unlike animals, every day I seek to transcend my animal nature, to become a better version of who I am. <mark>This endless quest to change the inner world, based on
          arbitrary standards of
          ethics, I will call <i>Spirituality</i>.</mark></p>

      <p>I live immersed in an invisible world of collective symbols and fictions that influence my every thought and move, as well as everyone around me. <mark>This virtual world of shared symbols I will call <i>Culture</i>.</mark></p>

      <p>I augment my influence over the physical world, beyond my body and mind's capabilities, through cumulative systems of knowledge and tools. <mark>This direct extension of power over the material world I will call <i>Technology</i>.</mark>

        <h3>I am young in the 21st Century.</h3>

        <p>The time I live in is both exhilarating and terrifying.</p>

        <p>Our species grows exponentially in scientific knowledge and technological power, tackling increasingly complex challenges and conquering peaks of achievement once deemed unreachable. It is an exciting age to be alive.</p>

        <p>Yet the biodiversity of the Earth is trampled under our progress, and we accelerate towards an ecological catastrophe that could well end our civilisation. Democracy is eroded, as the tools that were meant to connect us entrench us
          further into our ignorance and spread misinformation. Tech companies have grown into Leviathan's too gigantic to be challenged.</p>

        <p>We are ultra-connected yet increasingly isolated, depressed and anxious. Despite everything, we are still grappling with the same existential issues that plagued the prophets and philosophers of antiquity. We are not kind,
          patient,peaceful or happy, and each new tool we create amplifies and highlights individual and social flaws we never solved.</p>

        <h3>Considering the above, I am guided by the following:</h3>

        <p>An increase in technological skill is an increase in power.</p>

        <p>Any increase in power should be accompanied by a greater understanding of the cultural structures that guide that power, and an effort to become someone that will use that power wisely.</p>

        <p><mark>Therefore, I will learn about Technology, Culture and Spirituality together.</mark> I will do so through artistic projects that integrate all three.
        </p>

        <p>
          This page exists to share those projects. It's here to tell the story of what I am creating, and who I am becoming.
