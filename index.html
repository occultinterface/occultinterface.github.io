        I am an animal. Yet, unlike animals, every day I seek to transcend my basic nature. <mark>This quest to change the inner world I will call <i>Spirituality</i>.</mark></p>

      <p>I live immersed in an invisible world of collective symbols and fictions that guide my every thought and move. <mark>This virtual world of shared symbols I will call <i>Culture</i>.</mark></p>

      <p>I augment my influence over the physical world through systems of knowledge and tools. <mark>This extension of power over the material world I will call <i>Technology</i>.</mark></p>

        is in my hands right now. </p>
      <p>
        <i>More coming soon.</i>
